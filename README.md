#Netflix_analysis
Source of the dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows

This data analysis is a part of my portfolio of data ananlyst. During the analysis of this dataset I have found out some key finds with the help of figures:
1. Netflix distribute much movies compared to the TV Shows.
2. The Top 10 Netflix genres are mostly international movies and dramas, the rest other are having near to equal number of titles but the onternaltional movies and dramas are on whole another level.
3. The Top 10 countries producing Netflix content are consisting of United States, India, UK, Japan and so on. But USA are alone producing a vital amounts of content over netflix compared to even India which is on the second number of this list.
4. The content release over the years are normal until they reached 2019 from there on they had a spike on 2020 and then again they are going on a normal path but meanwhile if we see the data we will see they are having a downfall.
